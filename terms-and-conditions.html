        <p>This terms-of-use agreement is entered into between you and Alexei Chat App, a free android developer 
             (“<strong>developer</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or “<strong>us</strong>”) with a
            registered address at Spain, Cantabria, Santa Maria de Cayon, Saron. The following terms, together with any
            documents they expressly incorporate by reference (collectively, this “<strong>agreement</strong>”), govern
            your access to and use of the interactive chat and camera streaming service through the Company’s website
            located at Chat App (the “<strong>chat application</strong>”) and the Company’s mobile
            application (collectively, “<strong>Chat App</strong>”), including any content, functionality, and
            services offered on or through Chat App (the “<strong>Services</strong>”), whether as a guest or a
            registered user.</p>
        
        <p>Chat App is offered and available to users who are 18-years old or older. By using Chat App, you state

        <p class="ipc-sub-title">Changes to the Agreement</p>
        <p>We may revise and update this agreement from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective
            immediately when we post them and apply to all access to and use of Chat App afterwards. However, any
            changes to the dispute resolution provisions stated in Governing Law and Jurisdiction
            will not apply to any disputes for which the parties have actual notice on or before the date the change is
            posted on Chat App.</p>

            authorized payment processor in writing no later than 30 days after you receive the billing statement in
            which the error first appeared. <span class="red-txt">If you fail to notify within this 30-day deadline, you
                waive any disputed charges.</span> You must submit any billing disputes in writing using the <a

                entitle you to a refund in the future for similar instances; nor does it obligate us to provide refunds
                in the future, under any circumstance.</span></p>

        <p id="ipc-law" class="ipc-sub-title">Governing Law and Jurisdiction</p>
        <p> Wyoming law governs all matters relating to Chat App and this agreement and any dispute or claim arising
            from or related to it (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims) without giving effect to
            any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Wyoming or any other jurisdiction).
        </p>
        <p>Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of, or related to, this agreement or Chat App not subject
            to arbitration will be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of
            the state of Wyoming in each case located in the city of Sheridan and county of Sheridan, although we may
            bring any suit, action, or proceeding against you for breach of this agreement in your country of residence
            or any other relevant country. You waive all objections to the exercise of jurisdiction over you by those
            courts and to venue in those courts.</p>
        <p class="bold-txt">Arbitration—<span class="red-txt">Please Read the Following Clause Carefully—It May
                Significantly Affect Your Legal Rights, Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit in Court</span></p>
        <p class="bold-txt">At the Company’s sole discretion, it may require you to submit any dispute arising from or
            relating to this agreement, the <a href="/aup/">AUP</a>, or the use of Chat App to final and binding
            arbitration with Arbitration Resolution Services, Inc. (ARS). The parties will abide by all rules of ARS as
            found in their website at <a href="https://www.suzdalenko.com/"
                target="_blank">www.suzdalenko.com</a>. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court
            or agency, will have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the
            interpretation, enforceability, or formation of this agreement, including any claim that all or any part of
            this agreement is void or voidable. The arbitration will be conducted in the English language. Each party
            will be responsible for paying any filing, administrative, and arbitrator fees associated with the
            arbitration. The arbitrator may grant whatever relief that would be available in a court at law or in
            equity, except that the arbitrator must not award punitive or exemplary damages, or damages otherwise
            limited or excluded in this agreement. The arbitrator’s award will include costs of arbitration, reasonable
            legal fees, and reasonable costs for expert and other witnesses. If a party fails to pay any award, the
            award may be converted to judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction. Unless required by law, neither a
            party nor an arbitrator will disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration under this
            agreement without the advance written consent of both parties.</p>
        <p class="ipc-sub-title">Class Action Waiver</p>
        <p class="bold-txt">All claims arising out of or relating to this agreement, the AUP, or the
            Services must be brought in the parties’ individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any
            purported class or representative proceeding, and, unless we agree otherwise in writing, the arbitrator must
            not consolidate more than one person’s claims.</p>
        <p class="ipc-sub-title">Limitation on Time to File Claims</p>
        <p class="bold-txt">Any cause of action or claim you may have arising out of or relating to this agreement, the
            AUP, or the Services must be commenced within one year after the cause of action
            accrues, otherwise, that cause of action or claim is permanently barred.</p>
        <p class="ipc-sub-title">Waiver and Severability</p>
        <p>No waiver by the Company of any term stated in this agreement will be deemed a further or continuing waiver
            of that term or a waiver of any other term, and any failure of the Company to assert a right or provision
            under this agreement will not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.</p>
        <p>If any provision of this agreement is held by a court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction to be
            invalid, illegal, or unenforceable for any reason, that provision will be eliminated or limited to the
            minimum extent so that the remaining provisions of this agreement will continue in full effect.</p>
        <p class="ipc-sub-title">Entire Agreement</p>
        <p>This agreement and the AUP constitute the entire agreement between you and the Company
            regarding Chat App and the Services and supersedes all earlier and contemporaneous understandings,
            agreements, representations, and warranties, both written and oral, regarding Chat App and the Services.
